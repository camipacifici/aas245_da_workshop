Description
-----------

This workshop will cover several tools used for the data analysis
and visualization of JWST and Roman data. This includes the Jdaviz
visualization and data analysis package, the Advanced Scientific Data
Format (ASDF) package, specreduce, photutils PSF photometry, and
generalized world coordinate systems (gwcs). The goals are to introduce
participants to these tools and provide hands-on time for participants
to use the tools and ask questions to the developers. The format will
include short presentations followed by instructor-guided tutorials
using Jupyter notebooks.

Jdaviz is a package of astronomical data analysis visualization
tools based on the Jupyter platform. These GUI-based tools link data
visualization and interactive analysis. Presenters will provide examples
of the latest features available in the various configurations (Specviz,
Cubeviz, Imviz, and Specviz2d) and will guide attendees through basic
and advanced workflows to analyze JWST spectra and images.

The Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF) is a next-generation
interchange format for scientific data. It will be used as the data
format for Roman Space Telescope Level 1 - 4 data products.

The workshop will also cover the Astropy packages specreduce (spectral
extraction), photutils PSF photometry, and the generalized world
coordinates system package (gwcs).

There will be time spent on hands-on exercises. Participants must bring
a laptop with the software installed. Instructions on installing the
necessary software will be provided before the workshop and help will
be available at the workshop for those that experience problems with
installations.

The prerequisites are a familiarity with astronomical data analysis.
Basic Python experience is highly recommended to be able to participate
in the exercises. Those without Python experience will still be able to
use Jdaviz and gain useful information about the capabilities for data
analysis in Python.
