    "1. Starting Imviz and loading data.\n",
    "2. Setting display options for loaded data.\n",
    "3. Aligning images by pixel / wcs. Blinking between loaded images. \n",
    "4. Loading GAIA catalog and plotting sources on images. Zooming and panning on image.\n",
    "5. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demo will demonstrate how to do these tasks in the application UI, but this notebook has API calls to do the same steps programatically. (That is the magic of jdaviz!)\n"
